# convert-music-format

The following Python script demonstrates how to use Pydub to convert an MP3 file to a variety of audio formats:

This script reads an MP3 file from the input_file file path, converts it to the WAV, MP4, OGG, and FLAC audio formats,
and saves the new files to the output_formats dictionary's output file locations. 
The paths to the input and output files as well as the output formats can be changed to suit your requirements.
